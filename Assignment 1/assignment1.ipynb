    "# [COM4513-6513] Assignment 1: Text Classification with Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructor: Nikos Aletras\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop and test two text classification systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1:** sentiment analysis, in particular to predict the sentiment of movie review, i.e. positive or negative (binary classification).\n",
    "- **Task 2:** topic classification, to predict whether a news article is about International issues, Sports or Business (multiclass classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose, you will implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text processing methods for extracting Bag-Of-Word features, using (1) unigrams, bigrams and trigrams to obtain vector representations of documents. Two vector weighting schemes should be tested: (1) raw frequencies (**3 marks; 1 for each ngram type**); (2) tf.idf (**1 marks**).\n",
    "- Binary Logistic Regression classifiers that will be able to accurately classify movie reviews trained with (1) BOW-count (raw frequencies); and (2) BOW-tfidf (tf.idf weighted) for Task 1.\n",
    "- Multiclass Logistic Regression classifiers that will be able to accurately classify news articles trained with (1) BOW-count (raw frequencies); and (2) BOW-tfidf (tf.idf weighted) for Task 2.\n",
    "- The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to estimate the parameters of your Logistic Regression models. Your SGD algorithm should:\n",
    "    - Minimise the Binary Cross-entropy loss function for Task 1 (**3 marks**)\n",
    "    - Minimise the Categorical Cross-entropy loss function for Task 2 (**3 marks**)\n",
    "    - Use L2 regularisation (both tasks) (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Perform multiple passes (epochs) over the training data (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Randomise the order of training data after each pass (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Stop training if the difference between the current and previous validation loss is smaller than a threshold (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - After each epoch print the training and development loss (**1 mark**)\n",
    "- Discuss how did you choose hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate and regularisation strength)?  (**2 marks; 0.5 for each model in each task**).\n",
    "- After training the LR models, plot the learning process (i.e. training and validation loss in each epoch) using a line plot (**1 mark; 0.5 for both BOW-count and BOW-tfidf LR models in each task**) and discuss if your model overfits/underfits/is about right.\n",
    "- Model interpretability by showing the most important features for each class (i.e. most positive/negative weights). Give the top 10 for each class and comment on whether they make sense (if they don't you might have a bug!).  If we were to apply the classifier we've learned into a different domain such laptop reviews or restaurant reviews, do you think these features would generalise well? Can you propose what features the classifier could pick up as important in the new domain? (**2 marks; 0.5 for BOW-count and BOW-tfidf LR models respectively in each task**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data - Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for Task 1 are taken from here: [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/) and you can find it in the `./data_sentiment` folder in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_sentiment/train.csv`: contains 1,400 reviews, 700 positive (label: 1) and 700 negative (label: 0) to be used for training.\n",
    "- `data_sentiment/dev.csv`: contains 200 reviews, 100 positive and 100 negative to be used for hyperparameter selection and monitoring the training process.\n",
    "- `data_sentiment/test.csv`: contains 400 reviews, 200 positive and 200 negative to be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data - Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for Task 2 is a subset of the [AG News Corpus](http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html) and you can find it in the `./data_topic` folder in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_topic/train.csv`: contains 2,400 news articles, 800 for each class to be used for training.\n",
    "- `data_topic/dev.csv`: contains 150 news articles, 50 for each class to be used for hyperparameter selection and monitoring the training process.\n",
    "- `data_topic/test.csv`: contains 900 news articles, 300 for each class to be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit a Jupyter Notebook file (assignment1.ipynb) and an exported PDF version (you can do it from Jupyter: `File->Download as->PDF via Latex`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. You are not allowed to use any third-party library such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to comment your code. You should also mention if you've used Windows (not recommended) to write and test your code. There is no single correct answer on what your accuracy should be, but correct implementations usually achieve F1-scores around 80\\% or higher. The quality of the analysis of the results is as important as the accuracy itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be marked out of 20. It is worth 20\\% of your final grade in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this assignment is **23:59 on Fri, 20 Mar 2020** and it needs to be submitted via MOLE. Standard departmental penalties for lateness will be applied. We use a range of strategies to detect [unfair means](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/unfair-means/index), including Turnitin which helps detect plagiarism, so make sure you do not plagiarise."
